This folder contains serial, parallel and recursive implementations for Gaussian elimination without pivoting.
The serial code is simple with three for-loops for i,j,k.
The recursive code has divide and conquer approach to split the task into sub-problems (without parallelism).
The cilk code has the same divide and conquer algorithm with good amount of parallelism using cilk-support.
