This folder contains the cilk implementation of mergesort with paralle merge. This generates its input itself and hence an input file cannot be passed to it or nor can it accept input from stdin. (I had done this program to make the plots for the scalability analsys for inputs varying from 10^3 to 10^7). if you are looking for the mergesort to veryify the program I have written it in another folder "errorCheckingMSparMerge". The mergesort written in that file will accept stdin files and output to stdout .
